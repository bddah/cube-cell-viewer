# cube-cell-viewer
A simple viewer of a crystallographic cubic cell with the ability to add vectors and planes using the Miller indices: [hkl] and (hkl).

It is possible to save and load user-defined sets of vectors and planes. For example, you can upload an example file (111O.json) with a set of intersection directions of electrically neutral and mechanically compatible domain walls between polarization vectors of orthorhombic symmetr

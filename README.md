# Cube cell viewer
A simple viewer of a crystallographic cubic cell with the ability to add vectors and planes using the Miller indices: [hkl] and (hkl).

It is possible to save and load user-defined sets of vectors and planes. 


# How to run
Run the cube.html (needs web-access)
You can upload an example file (111O_all.json) with a set of intersection directions of electrically neutral and mechanically compatible ferroelectric domain walls between polarization vectors of orthorhombic symmetry.
